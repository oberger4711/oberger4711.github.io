                        This is a simple video stabilizer developed during one week-end.
                        It uses SIFT and RANSAC to estimate homographies between frames.
                        To smooth the camera trajectory, non-linear Least-Squares is used.
                        A single 'smoothness' parameter can be tuned by the user to achieve the desired smoothing behaviour.

                        KITcar is a university group of ~30 students (and only students) that develops a model car to enter the Carolo-Cup competition.
                        Our team won the Advanced-Class Carolo-Cup competition in 2018.

                        Our HTML 5 game ranked #20 overall of 116 entries and received an award.

                        I built and programmed a very simple four legged robot that can walk, turn, sit down and stand up.
                        I implemented a simulation of the robot's kinematics and dynamics to optimize the walking motion in order to keep the center of mass inside the support polygon.
                        TDD was used for the whole project.
