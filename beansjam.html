            <p>
                I participated in this 48 h game developement competition together with my sister.
                She made the graphics while I did the programming.
                The theme 'space mafia' was announced at the start of the competition.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have already participated in two other 48 h game jams before.
                In my opinion, the key for a good game that actually gets finished is implementing an idea that is both simple and innovative.
                Moreover I wanted the game to run in any modern browser without having to download anything.
                This greatly increases the probability that people actually play the game if they are interested.
                Therefore I wrote a pure HTML5 game.
                For programming I used Typescript.
                This is a object-oriented script language that transpiles to Javascript and makes it easier for people like me that are more familiar with languages like C# than with Javascript.
                I also used Phaser as an engine.
                This makes it easy to quickly get a prototype running.
                For example, nice tweening animations can be implemented in a single line.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final game can be played <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/beansjam/games/miese-attentaeter/257485">here</a>.
